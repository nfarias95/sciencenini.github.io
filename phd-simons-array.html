            <h2>Sensitivity analysis of the Simons Array experiment</h2>
            <p>Simons Array is an experiment designed to observe the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The experiment was located in the Atacama desert, in Chile, at an altitude of 5,200 meters.</p>

            <p>Searching for new cosmological signals requires unprecedented instrument sensitivity, which can be thought of as the signal-to-noise ratio of a receiver. Therefore, characterizing and optimizing sensitivity is of paramount importance to CMB experiments.</p>
            <p>During my PhD, I worked on understanding the sensitivity performance of the two Simons Array receivers, POLARBEAR-2a (PB-2a) and POLARBEAR-2b (PB-2b). My research included understanding the behavior of several receiver components, with emphasis on characterizing</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
                <li>the array of transition-edge sensors (TESs), which are highly responsive superconducting detectors</li>
                <li>the readout system, which in Simons Array employs digital frequency-domain multiplexing (DfMux) technology</li>
                <li>the receiver's throughput, which is a function of the transmission, reflection and absorption of optical elements</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Given that Simons Array employs thousands of TESs, and that the behavior of each TES is affected by several physical parameters, this work involved analysis of large-volume datasets, which I performed using mainly Python and SQL databases.</p>
